    "This type of parameter is essentially a filter, but instead of using an identifier it uses the term to match on. This might seem preferable than having to discover some cryptic identifer\n",
    "for a concept such a \"AAT300132254\", you can use the word \"Vase\" instead. However the downside of this is that you are only matching on the exact word you typed, so any variations such as \"Vases\", \"Pair of Vases\", \"Set of Vases\", and so on, will not be found. That's why controlled vocabularies are a superior way of filtering object records, and the single parameter this page describes will be replaced in a future version of the API with an identifier based filter, and this page will then thankfully disappear."
