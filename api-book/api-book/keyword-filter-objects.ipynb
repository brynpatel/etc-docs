    "This type of parameter is almost a real filter, but instead of using an identifier from a controlled vocabulary, it uses the term for the concept itself to match on. This might seem preferable than having to discover some cryptic identifer for a concept such a \"AAT300132254\", now you can use the word \"Vase\" instead. However the downside of this is that you are only matching on the exact word you typed, so any variations such as \"Vases\", \"Pair of Vases\", \"Set of Vases\", and so on, will not be found. That's why controlled vocabularies are a superior way of filtering object records (see previous propaganda for the joys of filtering {doc}`filtering:top`), and the parameter this page describes will ideally be replaced in a future version of the API with an identifier based filter instead, and this page will then be removed."
