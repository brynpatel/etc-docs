    "Cultural heritage data can be complex to process, every aspect of an objects' lifestory can be a world in itself to explore, which can make it hard to find a starting point for looking into the data.  To aid in finding these ways in, we have provided different responses to each endpoint (see below), a shorter CSV version containing summary information that may be easy to start with, and then the full JSON response containing all the object record data in its beautiful complexity. \n"

For the most common requests (retrieve an object record, query all object records) we provide a {ref}`quick-start:top` guide which we suggest you start with, after that the following sections go through in exhaustive detail the following endpoints and parameters:\n",

    "  * Clustering - An endpoint to return aggregation statistics for a query of object records\n",

    "  * Results - Different types of results that can be returned from different queries\n",
