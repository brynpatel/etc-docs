    "Boolean search is one of the most powerful methods available in search to help you find \"the needle in the haystack\" by letting you narrow down and remove irrelevant results to (ideally) reveal the set of records you want. But boolean search escalates in complexity as you start combining operators, and the subtle interactions between them can become challenging for even those with the most logical of minds to follow. \n",

    "  * Negated Searching  - e.g. -silver\n",

    "Perhaps the most simplest boolean operator to understand, phrase searching allows you to specify you want an exact phrase (a word or a sequence of words) to be matched, exactly as it is written. Normally in search, if you search for multiple words, any occurance of the words anywhere on the page will be considered a match. For example, if you want to search for any objects that contain the\n",
    "words *William Morris*, you probably do not want to see objects created by the (hyperthetical) partnership of \"William Smith\" and \"Jane Morris\", but these would be returned as they have the words you have searched for in. However, if you search instead using double quotes around the search words (e.g. *\"William Morris\"*), you will now only see a smaller number of results that have that exact phrase in.\n",
    "\n",
    "(N.B. of course, if you really want to only find objects connected to the Victorian Artist & Designer William Morris, you would be better use a filter either on the person, or on the maker if you are only interested in objects he was involved in creating, see {ref}`Filters`)\n"
