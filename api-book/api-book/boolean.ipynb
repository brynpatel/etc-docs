Normally in search, if you search for multiple words, any occurance of the words anywhere on the page will be considered a match. For example, if you want to search for any objects that contain the\n",
    "words *William Morris*, you probably do not want to see objects created by the partnership of \"William Smith\" and \"Jane Morris\", but these would be returned as they have the words you have searched for in. However, if you search instead using double quotes around the search words (e.g. *\"William Morris\"*), you will now only see a smaller number of results that have that exact phrase in.\n",
