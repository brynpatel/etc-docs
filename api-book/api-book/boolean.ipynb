    "Boolean search a powerful method available in search to help you find \"the needle in the haystack\" by improving the relevancy of the object records returned. But boolean search can escalate in complexity once you start combining operators, and the subtle interactions between them can become challenging for even those with the most logical of minds to predict. \n",

    "## Phrase searching\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most simplest boolean operator to understand, phrase searching allows you to specify you want an exact phrase (a word or a sequence of words) to be matched, exactly as written. Normally if you search for multiple words, any occurance of the words anywhere on the page will be considered a match. For example, if you want to search for any objects that contain the words 'William Morris', you may not want to see object records mentioning the (hyperthetical) partnership of \"William Smith\" and \"Jane Morris\", but these would be returned as they have the words 'William' and 'Morris' within them. However, if you search instead using double quotes around the search words (e.g. '\"William Morris\"'), you will now only see a smaller number of results that have that exact phrase in it.\n",
