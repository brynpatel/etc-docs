    "Filter parameters return (in comparision to search paramaters) more precise matching on object records of interest, by only returning those object records that exactly match the term(s) you have specified on a single field (or across a group of related fields), instead of matching in any field (as general search using \"q\" parameter does). In addition, these fields are vocabulary controlled (that is, instead of typing in the word to search for, we use an identifier instead such as \"A101\", or \"THES12345\" and so on) which avoids issues with variations in spelling (as search on a single field such as \"q_materials_techniques\" will need to deal with). Whilst this way of finding records is always preferred if possible, it does mean you need to know the right identifier to use. See XXX\n",

This could be for a few different reasons:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Some of the matches on the general search for the term 'Jet' are using it with other meanings, such as Jet Engine, Design for Jet Jewellery. These might be irrelvant to your search for objects made of Jet (although possibly the designs might also be of interest, this is where XXX)\n",
    "    * Some objects which are made of Jet have object records that have not been extensively catalogued, but they do mention in another (free-text) fields the object is made of Jet. These objects would be excluded from your search only on material and technique field, or filtering on the identifer for Jet (AAT45514)\n",
    "    * Some objects are made of a sub-type of Jet, such as XXX. These would not be found by filtering on Jet (AAT45514), as the identifier used would not match. For this to work (which is an future enhancement to the API), we would need some form of hierarchical filtering to enable matching on a type (Jet) and all its sub-types (.. Jet, .. Jet, etc) and their sub-types, and so on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So, in summary, while filtering on the identifier (the first query we ran) will provide the most precise results, it is likely to not return *all* relevant results.  Keep this in mind when you use filtering, that although the number returned gives the appearance of an exact count (e.g. the V&A holds 50 objects made of Jet), you should also compare this result with other searches (using 'q' and 'q_material_techniques'), to see if there are other objects not yet catalogued as extensively that would also match. And also, remember cataloguing, is a never ending process, so this number is likely to change over time."

    "### Combining filters with search\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem strange after talking about the precision of filtering to bring general search back into a query as well, but the combination of filtering and search is the most common\n",
    "XXX (collections web interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean support within filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking another way to exactly specify multiple filters is to provide support for the boolean operators available to search parameters within a filter param. For example using id_person=\"A6630|A6631\" to indicate you want object records mentioning either A6630 or A6631 or both of them. You might also think you could further extend this to even more complex filtering by using boolean operators in multiple parameters (id_person, id_material, etc); to specify the way you want filters to be combined (e.g. applying boolean AND between facets ('tightening', boolean OR within facets ('broadening'), except for materials facet where boolean negation applies, except for material type silver which must be present on all matching object records. You would rightly think this would then provide you with a more granualar way to control search mode, per facet instead of forcing them all to be \"broad\" or \"narrow\" as the \"search_mode\" parameter does.\n",

    "You might think all this, but at present it is not supported.\n"
