The V&A makes available under <a href="">licence</a> more than 1 million collections records about its <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections">collections</a>  and over half a million objects with images for you to explore, play and research with.

This information is made available though our APIs, for the collections data (information about objects in our collections) and for the collection images (images of objects in our collections).
