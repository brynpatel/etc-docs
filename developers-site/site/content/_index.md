title: 'V&A Data & APIs'
---
The V&A makes available more than 1 million <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections">collections records</a> and over half a million images for you to explore, research, share, and play with.

This information is made available though our APIs, under <a href="">licence</a>, for the collections data (information about objects in our collections) and for the collection images (images of objects in our collections).

## Getting started

To use our APIs, take a look at our <a href="https://developers.vam.ac.uk/guide/v2/" class="developers-page__navigation-link"> API Guide</a> and <a href="https://api.vam.ac.uk/docs" class="developers-page__navigation-link">API Reference</a>.

For our images API, <a href="/images" class="developers-page__navigation-link">see our (brief) documentation</a>.

## Previous work

Our original API from 2009 is still available, with the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/api" class="developers-page__navigation-link">historical documentation</a>.
