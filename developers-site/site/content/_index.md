title: 'V&A Data & APIs'
---
The V&A makes available more than 1 million <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections">collections records</a> and over half a million images for you to explore, research, share, and play with.

This information is made available though our APIs, under <a href="">licence</a>, for exploring the collections metadata (information about the objects in our collections) and for displaying the collection images (images of objects in our collections).

## Getting started

To use our APIs, take a look at our <a href="https://developers.vam.ac.uk/guide/v2/" class="developers-page__navigation-link"> API Guide</a> and <a href="https://api.vam.ac.uk/docs" class="developers-page__navigation-link">API Reference</a>.

If you would like to see some worked examples exploring the collections data, look through our <a href="/explorations/" class="developers-page__navigation-link">>Data Explorations</a> notebooks.

For using our image API, <a href="/images" class="developers-page__navigation-link">see our brief documentation</a> or read on more depth the <a href="https://iiif.io/">IIIF Image API</a> standard.

## v1 API

Our original API from 2009 is still available, with the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/api" class="developers-page__navigation-link">historical documentation</a>.
