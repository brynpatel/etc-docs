Introduction
============================

This is a collection of worked examples exploring the V&A collections using the [V&A Collections API](https://developers.vam.ac.uk/guide/v2/)
often combined with another institutions' collections' data, APIs, areas of research or just an excuse for the author to draw some more treemap visualisations.

The site is built using:
  * Jupyter Notebooks
  * Jupyter Book
  * Pandas
  * Altair
  * Ivpy
  * Python

No art historical conclusions should be drawn from these elaborate and tenuous examples of data science
applied to cultural heritage collections, but we hope they provide some ideas for some more interesting explorations.
