Introduction
============================

This is a collection of worked examples exploring the V&A collections using the [V&A Collections API](https://developers.vam.ac.uk/guide/v2/)
often combined with another institutions' collections' data, APIs, areas of research or just an excuse for the author to draw some more treemap
visualisations.

The site is built mostly using:
  * [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
  * [Jupyter Book](jupyterbook.org/)
  * [Pandas](pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Altair](altair-viz.github.io/)
  * [Ivpy](https://github.com/damoncrockett/ivpy)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/)

No art historical conclusions should be drawn from these elaborate yet tenuous examples of vaguely data science techniques
applied to cultural heritage collections, but we hope they provide some ideas for some other interesting explorations.
