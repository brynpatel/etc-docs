Introduction
============================

This is a collection of worked examples exploring the V&A collections using the V&A Collections API
often combined with another institutions' collections' data, API, area of research or just an excuse to for the author to draw some more treemap diagrams.

The site is built using:
  * Jupyter Notebooks
  * Jupyter Book
  * Pandas
  * Altair
  * Ivpy
  * Python

No art historical conclusions should be drawn from these elaborate and tenuous examples of data science
applied to cultural heritage collections. 

If you would like to contribute a notebook with some use of our API to explore our data, please send a pull request via GitHub.
